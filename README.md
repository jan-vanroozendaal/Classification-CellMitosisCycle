# Classification-CellMitosisCycle
Portfolio Item of classifying cells by their phase in the mitosis cycle using machine learning algorithms in R.

Each of the R-scripts include SMOTE to deal with oversampling and feature selection techniques for dimension reduction for the final classification algorithm.

* `kNN` - uses k-nearest neighbors for classification
* `SVM` - uses support vector machines for classificaiton
* `XGBoost` - uses the XGBoost gradient boosted decision trees algorithm for classification
