# Classification-CellMitosisCycle
Portfolio Item of classifying cells by their phase in the mitosis cycle using machine learning algorithms in R.

Each of the R-scripts include SMOTE to deal with oversampling and feature selection techniques for dimension reduction for the final classification algorithm.

* `kNN` - uses k-nearest neighbors for classification
* `SVM` - uses support vector machines for classificaiton
* `XGBoost` - uses the XGBoost gradient boosted decision trees algorithm for classification

Each of the folders contains a `readme.txt` file where a link is provided to the R-workspace named `.Rdata`, as GitHub only limits file uploads up to 25MB. Save this `.Rdata` in the same folder where you store the R-script.
